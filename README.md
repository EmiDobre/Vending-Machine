# VHDL Vending Machine Project

## Overview:
This VHDL project implements a basic vending machine simulation. The vending machine dispenses items upon receiving the correct amount of money. It also provides the functionality to return any excess money inserted by the user.

## Features:
- **Item Dispensing**: Upon receiving the correct amount of money, the vending machine dispenses the selected item.
- **Money Return**: Any excess money inserted by the user is returned.
- **Restocking**: Ability to restock items in the vending machine.

## Usage:
1. **Simulation**: Simulate the VHDL code using a compatible simulation tool 
2. **Testing**: Use the provided testbench to verify the functionality of the vending machine.
